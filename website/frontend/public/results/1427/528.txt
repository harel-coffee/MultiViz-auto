The film begins as a little girl accidentally left at school at the end of the day is forced to find her own way home despite not knowing her address. Then, abruptly, it becomes a documentary -- as the child actress decides that, like the character she was playing, she needs to go home immediately. The set is plunged into chaos as the filmmakers and actors struggle to navigate the city streets of modern Iran.
