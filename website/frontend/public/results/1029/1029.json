Almost immediately after launching, Zero-X faces technical difficulties, forcing its crew to abort the mission and eject from the craft before it crashes back down to Earth into the sea. Two years later, a redesigned and reconstructed Zero-X is ready for a second manned attempt to reach Mars, which coincides with the Space Exploration Center's finding that the first mission was sabotaged. As such, they recruit the Thunderbirds - ex-astronaut Jeff Tracy and his four sons Scott Tracy, Virgil Tracy, Alan Tracy and Gordon Tracy, each in his own Thunderbird air craft - to oversee security. By their side in the Fab1 mobile center on Earth is the beautiful Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward. The Thunderbirds not only have to prevent possible sabotage a second time around, but also deal with any other possible technical difficulties that may arise that requires on hands support. Through the Thunderbirds' mission, Alan begins to feel under-appreciated in his role, which culminates with a life and death task for both himself and the crew of Zero-X.",

Humanity's continued survival depends on an anti-radiation drug only available on planet Delta Three, which has been taken over by Omus, a brilliant but mad mechanic who places no value on human life. Omus wants to come to the Moon to rule and intends to attack it by ramming robot-controlled spaceships into the domes. Dr. John Caball, his son Jason, Jason's friend, Kim, and a robot named Sparks embark on Caball's space battlecruiser on an unauthorized mission to Delta Three to stop Omus.",
