Sometime in the late twenty-first century, the space craft Zero-X is embarking on a manned mission to Mars, the first mission of its kind. Almost immediately after launching, Zero-X faces technical difficulties, forcing its crew to abort the mission and eject from the craft before it crashes back down to Earth into the sea. Two years later, a redesigned and reconstructed Zero-X is ready for a second manned attempt to reach Mars, which coincides with the Space Exploration Center's finding that the first mission was sabotaged. As such, they recruit the Thunderbirds - ex-astronaut Jeff Tracy and his four sons Scott Tracy, Virgil Tracy, Alan Tracy and Gordon Tracy, each in his own Thunderbird air craft - to oversee security. By their side in the Fab1 mobile center on Earth is the beautiful Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward. The Thunderbirds not only have to prevent possible sabotage a second time around, but also deal with any other possible technical difficulties that may arise that requires on hands support. Through the Thunderbirds' mission, Alan begins to feel under-appreciated in his role, which culminates with a life and death task for both himself and the crew of Zero-X.
